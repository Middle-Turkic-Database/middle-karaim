						<l n="1" xml:id="Ruth-002-001">And Naomi had a friend
							<milestone unit="line" n="2"/>of her husband’s, a mighty man of the army, of the family of Elimelech; and his name
							<milestone unit="line" n="3"/>was Boaz.
						</l>
						<l n="2" xml:id="Ruth-002-002">And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, ‘Let me go
							<milestone unit="line" n="4"/>now to the field, and glean ears of grain after him in whose
							<milestone unit="line" n="5"/>sight I shall find grace.’ And she said to her, ‘Go, my daughter.’
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="6"/>
						<l n="3" xml:id="Ruth-002-003">And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
							<milestone unit="line" n="7"/>reapers: and she happened to come to a part of the field that
							<milestone unit="line" n="8"/>was of Boaz who was of the family of Elimelech.
						</l>
						<l n="4" xml:id="Ruth-002-004">And, behold,
							<milestone unit="line" n="9"/>Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, ‘The Lord be with you.’
							<milestone unit="line" n="10"/>And they answered him, ‘The Lord bless you.’
						</l>
						<l n="5" xml:id="Ruth-002-005">Then said Boaz
							<milestone unit="line" n="11"/>to his servant standing over the reapers, ‘Whose
							<milestone unit="line" n="12"/>young woman is this?’
						</l>
						<l n="6" xml:id="Ruth-002-006">And answered the servant that was set over
							<milestone unit="line" n="13"/>the reapers and said, ‘It is the Moabite woman
							<milestone unit="line" n="14"/>that came back with Naomi out of the plain of Moab.
						</l>
						<l n="7" xml:id="Ruth-002-007">And she said,
							<milestone unit="line" n="15"/>“Let me glean now and gather among the sheaves after the reapers”.
							<milestone unit="line" n="16"/>And she came and has continued from early morning until now, she
							<milestone unit="line" n="17"/>sat a little in the house.’
						</l>
						<l n="8" xml:id="Ruth-002-008">And Boaz said to Ruth,
							<milestone unit="line" n="18"/>‘Behold, listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field
							<milestone unit="line" n="19"/>or even leave this one, but keep close thus to my maid-servants.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="20"/>
						<l n="9" xml:id="Ruth-002-009">Let your eyes be on the field that they are reaping, and go after them.
							<milestone unit="line" n="21"/>Behold, I have instructed the servants not to touch you. And when you are thirsty,
							<milestone unit="line" n="22"/>go to the vessels and drink of that which the servants would say.’
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="23"/>
						<l n="10" xml:id="Ruth-002-010">Then she fell on her face, and bowed to the ground, and said
							<milestone unit="line" n="24"/>to him, ‘Why have I found grace in your eyes, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?’
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="25"/>
						<l n="11" xml:id="Ruth-002-011">And Boaz answered her, and said to her ‘It has fully been told to me,
							<milestone unit="page" n="224v"/>
							<milestone unit="line" n="1"/>all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of 
							<supplied reason="lost">your</supplied> husband: and how you have left
							<milestone unit="line" n="2"/>your father and your mother, and the land of your birth and came to a people
							<milestone unit="line" n="3"/>that you 
							<supplied reason="lost">did not know</supplied>
							<ref n="1" target="#Ruth-002-fn1" type="noteAnchor"/> the day before.
						</l>
						<l n="12" xml:id="Ruth-002-012">May the Lord pay your reward
							<milestone unit="line" n="4"/>for what you have done, and may a full reward be given you by the Lord, the God
							<milestone unit="line" n="5"/>of Israel, under whose providence you have come to take refuge!’
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="6"/>
						<l n="13" xml:id="Ruth-002-013">Then she said, ‘I found favour in the eyes of my lord; for
							<milestone unit="line" n="7"/>you have comforted me, and you have spoken to the hearts of your handmaids,
							<milestone unit="line" n="8"/>though I am not one of your servants.
						</l>
						<l n="14" xml:id="Ruth-002-014">And Boaz said
							<milestone unit="line" n="9"/>to her at mealtime, ‘Come closer, and eat
							<milestone unit="line" n="10"/>of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.’ And she sat
							<milestone unit="line" n="11"/>beside the reapers: and he passed to her roasted grain
							<ref n="2" target="#Ruth-002-fn2" type="noteAnchor"/>, and she ate,
							<milestone unit="line" n="12"/>and left.
						</l>
						<l n="15" xml:id="Ruth-002-015">And she rose to glean, and Boaz instructed his servants,
							<milestone unit="line" n="13"/>saying, ‘Let her gather even among the sheaves, and do not put her to shame.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="14"/>
						<l n="16" xml:id="Ruth-002-016">And also leave some from the sheaves for her and
							<milestone unit="line" n="15"/>leave it for her to gather, and do not rebuke her.’
						</l>
						<l n="17" xml:id="Ruth-002-017">And she gleaned in the field
							<milestone unit="line" n="16"/>until evening, and she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about a 
							<emph>kebič</emph>
							<ref n="3" target="#Ruth-002-fn3" type="noteAnchor"/>
							<milestone unit="line" n="17"/>of barley.
						</l>
						<l n="18" xml:id="Ruth-002-018">And she took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw
							<milestone unit="line" n="18"/>what she had gleaned and she also brought out and gave to her what she had reserved after she was satisfied.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="19"/>
						<l n="19" xml:id="Ruth-002-019">And her mother-in-law said to her, ‘Where did you glean today? And where
							<milestone unit="line" n="20"/>did you work? May the man who took notice of you be blessed.’ So she told her mother-in-law
							<milestone unit="line" n="21"/>whom she had gathered with and said, ‘The man’s name with whom I gathered
							<milestone unit="line" n="22"/>today is Boaz.’
						</l>
						<l n="20" xml:id="Ruth-002-020">And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, ‘May he be blessed
							<milestone unit="line" n="23"/>by the Lord, who has not left off his kindness to the living or the dead!’
							<milestone unit="line" n="24"/>and Naomi said to her, ‘A close relative of ours is the man, one of our redeemers.’
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="25"/>
						<l n="21" xml:id="Ruth-002-021">And Ruth the Moabite said, ‘Besides, he
							<milestone unit="page" n="225r"/>
							<milestone unit="line" n="1"/>also said to me, “You shall keep close by the servants of mine until they have completed
							<milestone unit="line" n="2"/>all my harvest.”’
						</l>
						<l n="22" xml:id="Ruth-002-022">And Naomi said
							<milestone unit="line" n="3"/>to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, ‘It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maid-servants,
							<milestone unit="line" n="4"/>let them not meet you in another field.’
						</l>
						<l n="23" xml:id="Ruth-002-023">And she kept close
							<milestone unit="line" n="5"/>to the maid-servants of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley harvest
							<milestone unit="line" n="6"/>and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.
