						</l>
						<l n="2" xml:id="Ruth-003-002">And now is not Boaz
							<milestone unit="line" n="6"/>our friend, with whose maid-servants you were? Behold, he yanks
							<milestone unit="line" n="7"/>barley tonight in the threshing-floor.
						</l>
						<l n="3" xml:id="Ruth-003-003">And wash therefore and pour 
							<supplied reason="lost">water on</supplied> yourself,
							<milestone unit="line" n="8"/>and put on your clothes and go down to the threshing-floor, but do not make yourself known
							<milestone unit="line" n="9"/>to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
						</l>
						<l n="4" xml:id="Ruth-003-004">And it shall be, when he lies down,
							<milestone unit="line" n="10"/>get know the place where he lies, and then go in, and uncover your feet,
							<milestone unit="line" n="11"/>and lay down; and he will tell you what you shall do.
						</l>
						<l n="5" xml:id="Ruth-003-005">
							<milestone unit="line" n="12"/>And she said to her, ‘All that you would say to me I will do.’
						</l>
						<l n="6" xml:id="Ruth-003-006">And she went down
							<milestone unit="line" n="13"/>to the threshing-floor and did all that her mother-in-law commanded her.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="14"/>
						<l n="7" xml:id="Ruth-003-007">And Boaz ate and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down
							<milestone unit="line" n="15"/>at the edge of the stack: and she came softly and uncovered his feet
							<milestone unit="line" n="16"/>and laid herself down.
						</l>
						<l n="8" xml:id="Ruth-003-008">And it was at midnight,
							<milestone unit="line" n="17"/>that the man was startled, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="18"/>
						<l n="9" xml:id="Ruth-003-009">And he said, ‘Who are you?’ And she answered, ‘I am Ruth, your maid-servant: spread
							<milestone unit="line" n="19"/>therefore your wings over your servant, for you are a redeemer.’
						</l>
						<l n="10" xml:id="Ruth-003-010">And he said,
							<milestone unit="line" n="20"/>‘Blessed be you of the Lord, my daughter: you have made this last kindness

						<l n="11" xml:id="Ruth-003-011">And now, my daughter, do not fear; all that

							<milestone unit="line" n="1"/>you ask I will do for you for all the city of my people does know
							<milestone unit="line" n="2"/>that you are a strong woman.

						<l n="12" xml:id="Ruth-003-012">And now it is true that
							<milestone unit="line" n="3"/>I am a redeemer; yet there is a redeemer nearer than I.

						<l n="13" xml:id="Ruth-003-013">
							<milestone unit="line" n="4"/>Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will redeem,
							<milestone unit="line" n="5"/>fine, may he redeem you, but if he is not willing to redeem you then will I redeem you,
							<milestone unit="line" n="6"/>as the Lord lives, lie down until the morning.’
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="7"/>
						<l n="14" xml:id="Ruth-003-014">And she laid at his feet until the morning: and she rose up
							<milestone unit="line" n="8"/>before one could recognize another, and Boaz said, ‘Let it not be known
							<milestone unit="line" n="9"/>that a woman came into the threshing-floor.’
						</l>
						<l n="15" xml:id="Ruth-003-015">And he said, ‘Give
							<milestone unit="line" n="10"/>me the cloak that you have on 
							<supplied reason="lost">you</supplied> and hold it.’ And she held it, and he measured out
							<milestone unit="line" n="11"/>six measures of barley and put it on her, and went into the city.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="12"/>
						<l n="16" xml:id="Ruth-003-016">And she came to her mother-in-law, and she said, ‘Who are you, my daughter’, and she told
							<milestone unit="line" n="13"/>her all that the man had done for her.
						</l>
						<l n="17" xml:id="Ruth-003-017">
							<milestone unit="line" n="14"/>And she said, ‘These six measures of barley he gave me; for he said to me,
							<milestone unit="line" n="15"/>“Go not empty to your mother-in-law.”’
						</l>
						<l n="18" xml:id="Ruth-003-018">Then she said, ‘Sit still, my daughter,
							<milestone unit="line" n="16"/>until you know how the words will fall: for the man will not rest,
							<milestone unit="line" n="17"/>until he has finished the matter today.’
