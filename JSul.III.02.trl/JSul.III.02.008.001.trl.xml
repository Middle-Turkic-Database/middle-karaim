						<milestone unit="line" n="3"/>
						<l n="1" xml:id="Ruth-001-001">It came to pass in the days when the judges
							<milestone unit="line" n="4"/>ruled, that there was a famine in the land, and a man of Beth-lehem-
							<milestone unit="line" n="5"/>judah went to sojourn in the plain of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two
							<milestone unit="line" n="6"/>sons with him.
						</l>
						<l n="2" xml:id="Ruth-001-002">And the name of the man was Elimelech,
							<milestone unit="line" n="7"/>and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon
							<milestone unit="line" n="8"/>and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehemjudah, and they came
							<milestone unit="line" n="9"/>into the plain of Moab, and remained there.
						</l>
						<l n="3" xml:id="Ruth-001-003">And Elimelech the husband
							<milestone unit="line" n="10"/>of Naomi died; and she was left, and her two sons.
						</l>
						<l n="4" xml:id="Ruth-001-004">And they took
							<milestone unit="line" n="11"/>them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name
							<milestone unit="line" n="12"/>of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="13"/>
						<l n="5" xml:id="Ruth-001-005">And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left
							<milestone unit="line" n="14"/>without her two sons and her husband.
						</l>
						<l n="6" xml:id="Ruth-001-006">Then she arose
							<milestone unit="line" n="15"/>and her daughters-in-law, to return from the plain of Moab: for she had heard in the plain
							<milestone unit="line" n="16"/>of Moab how that the Lord had remembered his people in giving them bread.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="17"/>
						<l n="7" xml:id="Ruth-001-007">So she set out from the place where she and her two daughters-in-law with her were,
							<milestone unit="line" n="18"/>and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
						</l>
						<l n="8" xml:id="Ruth-001-008">
							<milestone unit="line" n="19"/>And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, ‘Go, return each of you to her mother’s house:
							<milestone unit="line" n="20"/>May the Lord deal kindly as you have dealt with the dead, and
							<milestone unit="line" n="21"/>with me.
						</l>
						<l n="9" xml:id="Ruth-001-009">The Lord grant you that you may find rest, each of you
							<milestone unit="line" n="22"/>in the house of her husband.’ And she kissed them; and they lifted up their voices, and wept.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="23"/>
						<l n="10" xml:id="Ruth-001-010">And they said to her, ‘We will return with you to your people.</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="24"/>
						<l n="11" xml:id="Ruth-001-011">And Naomi said, ‘Return, my daughters: why will you go
							<milestone unit="line" n="25"/>with me? Are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may become
							<milestone unit="page" n="223v"/>
							<milestone unit="line" n="1"/>your husbands?
						</l>
						<l n="12" xml:id="Ruth-001-012">Return, my daughters, go,
							<milestone unit="line" n="2"/>for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have
							<milestone unit="line" n="3"/>hope, if I should have a husband also tonight, and should also bear
							<milestone unit="line" n="4"/>sons;
						</l>
						<l n="13" xml:id="Ruth-001-013">Would you have hope for them till
							<milestone unit="line" n="5"/>they were grown? Would you be late for them, being not given to a husband? No,
							<milestone unit="line" n="6"/>my daughters; it grieves me much for your sakes for
							<milestone unit="line" n="7"/>the hand of the Lord has gone out against me.’
						</l>
						<l n="14" xml:id="Ruth-001-014">And they lifted up their voices,
							<milestone unit="line" n="8"/>and wept again: and Orphah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth clung to her.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="9"/>
						<l n="15" xml:id="Ruth-001-015">And she said, ‘Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people,
							<milestone unit="line" n="10"/>and to her god: return you after your sister-in-law.’
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="11"/>
						<l n="16" xml:id="Ruth-001-016">But Ruth said, ‘Do not beg me to leave you
							<milestone unit="line" n="12"/>to return from following after you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge
							<milestone unit="line" n="13"/>I will lodge: your people are my people, and your God my God.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="14"/>
						<l n="17" xml:id="Ruth-001-017">Where you die, there will I die, and there will I be buried:
							<milestone unit="line" n="15"/>the Lord do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts
							<milestone unit="line" n="16"/>me and you.’
						</l>
						<l n="18" xml:id="Ruth-001-018">And she saw that she became strong 
							<supplied reason="lost">in her will</supplied>to go
							<milestone unit="line" n="17"/>with her, she stopped speaking to her.
						</l>
						<l n="19" xml:id="Ruth-001-019">And they went on,
							<milestone unit="line" n="18"/>two of them, until they came to Bethlehem. And the whole town was talking loudly
							<milestone unit="line" n="19"/>about them, and said: ‘Is this Naomi?’
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="20"/>
						<l n="20" xml:id="Ruth-001-020">And she said to them, ‘Call me not Naomi, call me
							<milestone unit="line" n="21"/>Mara for the powerful God has troubled me much.
						</l>
						<l n="21" xml:id="Ruth-001-021">I went away full
							<milestone unit="line" n="22"/>and the Lord has brought me back empty: why call me Naomi, when the powerful 
							<milestone unit="line" n="23"/>has testified for me and has been bad for me?’
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="24"/>
						<l n="22" xml:id="Ruth-001-022">So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her,
							<milestone unit="line" n="25"/>who returned out of the plain of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem
							<milestone unit="page" n="224r"/>
							<milestone unit="line" n="1" xml:id="Ruth001-P224r-L1" next="JSul.III.02.008.002.xml#Ruth002-P224r-L1"/>in the beginning of barley harvest.
