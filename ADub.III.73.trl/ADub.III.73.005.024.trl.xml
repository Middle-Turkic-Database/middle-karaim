disgraceful, because that is a repulsive thing before<milestone unit="line" n="4"/>the Lord, and you shall not make the land sinful which the Lord<milestone unit="line" n="5"/>your God is giving you for an inheritance.</l><l n="5">If a man takes a new<milestone unit="line" n="6"/>wife, he shall not go out to war, and no matter shall go through him.<milestone unit="line" n="7"/>He shall be free in his house one year and shall make<milestone unit="line" n="8"/>his wife whom he has taken happy.</l><l n="6">One shall not take<milestone unit="line" n="9"/>a lower |mill|stone of a mill or an upper |mill|stone of a mill as security,<milestone unit="line" n="10"/>because he takes a man’s fruit as security.</l><l n="7">If a man is found<milestone unit="line" n="11"/>stealing any of a soul from his brethren of the children<milestone unit="line" n="12"/>of Israel, and if he gets profit by |means of| a weaponry matter and sells<milestone unit="line" n="13"/>him, then that thief shall die and you shall drive the evil away<milestone unit="line" n="14"/>from your midst.</l><l n="8">Take heed to yourself<milestone unit="line" n="15"/>that you watch out, very much, for the disease of leprosy and do according to all<milestone unit="line" n="16"/>that the priests the Levites shall teach you.<milestone unit="line" n="17"/>As I commanded them, so you shall observe to do.</l><l n="9">Remember<milestone unit="line" n="18"/>what the Lord your God did to Miriam on the way,<milestone unit="line" n="19"/>when you were coming out from Egypt.</l><l n="10">If you give a
