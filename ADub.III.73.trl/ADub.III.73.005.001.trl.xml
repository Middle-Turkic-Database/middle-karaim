						<l>
							<emph>The Book of Deuteronomy</emph>
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="2" />
						<l n="1">These are the words
							<milestone unit="line" n="3" />which Moses spoke to all Israel at the ford
							<milestone unit="line" n="4" />of Jordan in the wilderness, in the steppe opposite Suph,
							<milestone unit="line" n="5" />between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth
							<milestone unit="line" n="6" />and Di-Zahab.
						</l>
						<l n="2">It was eleven days’ journey from Horeb
							<milestone unit="line" n="7" />by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-Barnea.
						</l>
						<l n="3">And
							<milestone unit="line" n="8" />it was in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day
							<milestone unit="line" n="9" />of the month: Moses spoke to the children of Israel
							<milestone unit="line" n="10" />everything that the Lord had commanded through him to them.
						</l>
						<l n="4">
							<milestone unit="line" n="11" />After he had slain Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt
							<milestone unit="line" n="12" />in Heshbon, |and| Og, king of Bashan, who dwelt
							<milestone unit="line" n="13" />at Ashtaroth at Edrei,
						</l>
						<l n="5">At the ford
							<milestone unit="line" n="14" />of Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses decided to explain
							<milestone unit="line" n="15" />this Law, saying,
						</l>
						<l n="6">‘The Lord our God
							<milestone unit="line" n="16" />spoke to us in Horeb, saying, “You have had enough of staying
							<milestone unit="line" n="17" />at this mountain.
						</l>
						<l n="7">Turn and set out and
							<milestone unit="line" n="18" />come to the mountain of the Amorites, and to all their neighbours,
							<milestone unit="line" n="19" />in the steppe, in the hills, and in the lowland, and in the south, and by the sea shore,
							<milestone unit="line" n="20" />to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, to the great
							<milestone unit="page" n="279v" />
							<milestone unit="line" n="1" />river, the river Euphrates.
						</l>
						<l n="8">See: I have set
							<milestone unit="line" n="2" />the land before you. Come and inherit the land
							<milestone unit="line" n="3" />which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
							<milestone unit="line" n="4" />to give to them and to their offspring after them.”
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="5" />
						<l n="9">And I spoke to you at that time, saying,
							<milestone unit="line" n="6" />“I am not able to carry you myself alone.
						</l>
						<l n="10">The Lord
							<milestone unit="line" n="7" />your God has multiplied you, and, lo, you are today as the stars
							<milestone unit="line" n="8" />of heaven for multitude.
						</l>
						<l n="11">May the Lord, God
							<milestone unit="line" n="9" />of your fathers, add on to you a thousand times so many more

							<emph> you </emph>

						</l>
						<l n="12">How
							<milestone unit="line" n="11" />can I myself alone carry your stress and your burden and
							<milestone unit="line" n="12" />your strife?
						</l>
						<l n="13">Take you wise men,

							<addSpan spanTo="#add002" />
							<emph>according</emph>
							<supplied reason="lost">to your tribes</supplied>
							<anchor xml:id="add002" />, and I will set them superiors

						</l>
						<l n="14">
							<emph>And you answer</emph>
							<supplied reason="lost">ed</supplied>
							<emph>me,</emph>
							<supplied reason="lost">and said</supplied>, “<emph>The word</emph>
							<supplied reason="lost">which</supplied>
							<emph>you have</emph>
							<supplied reason="lost">spoken</supplied>
							<emph>is</emph>
							<supplied reason="lost">good</supplied>
							<emph>to do</emph>.” <supplied reason="lost"></supplied>
						</l>
						<l n="15">
							<supplied reason="lost"> And</supplied>
							<emph>I took</emph>
							<supplied reason="lost">the</supplied>
							<emph>superiors of your</emph>
							<supplied reason="lost">tribes, wise</supplied>
							<emph>men, and known, and set them superiors over you</emph>
							<anchor xml:id="add004" />, superiors of thousands and superiors of hundreds
							<milestone unit="line" n="15" />and superiors of fifties and superiors of tens and overseers
							<milestone unit="line" n="16" />for your tribes.
						</l>
						<l n="16">And I directed your judges
							<milestone unit="line" n="17" />at that time, saying, “Hear between your brothers
							<milestone unit="line" n="18" />and judge righteously between every man and
							<milestone unit="line" n="19" />his brother and between the stranger.
						</l>
						<l n="17">
							<milestone unit="line" n="20" />You shall not favour in judgment, you shall hear the small as well as the great.
							<milestone unit="line" n="21" />You shall not be afraid before of man, because the judgment is God’s. And the
							<milestone unit="page" n="280r" />
							<milestone unit="line" n="1" />word that is too hard for you to understand it: bring it forward to me, and
							<milestone unit="line" n="2" />I will hear it.”
						</l>
						<l n="18">And I commanded you at that time
							<milestone unit="line" n="3" />all the words which you should do.
						</l>
						<l n="19">And
							<milestone unit="line" n="4" />we set out from Horeb, we walked in all that great and awesome wilderness
							<milestone unit="line" n="5" />which you saw by the way of the mountain of the
							<milestone unit="line" n="6" />Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us, and
							<milestone unit="line" n="7" />we came to Kadesh-Barnea.
						</l>
						<l n="20">And I said to you,
							<milestone unit="line" n="8" />“You have come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord our God
							<milestone unit="line" n="9" />gave to us.
						</l>
						<l n="21">See: the Lord your God
							<milestone unit="line" n="10" />has set the land before you. Go up and inherit it, as the
							<milestone unit="line" n="11" />Lord God of your fathers has said to you. Do not fear and do not be broken down.”
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="12" />
						<l n="22">And you came near to me, every one of you, and said,
							<milestone unit="line" n="13" />“We will send men before us, and they shall spy for us out
							<milestone unit="line" n="14" />the land, and bring us back a word of answer of the way
							<milestone unit="line" n="15" />by which we will go up and of the cities to which we will come.”
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="16" />
						<l n="23">And the thing seemed good in my eyes,
							<milestone unit="line" n="17" />and I took twelve men of you, one of each tribe.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="18" />
						<l n="24">And they turned and went up to the mountain and
							<milestone unit="line" n="19" />came to |the valley of| the river of Eshcol and spied it out.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="20" />
						<l n="25">And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and
							<milestone unit="line" n="21" />brought it down to us, and brought us a word of answer again, and said,
							<milestone unit="page" n="280v" />
							<milestone unit="line" n="1" />“It is a good land which the Lord our God does give us.”
						</l>
						<l n="26">But
							<milestone unit="line" n="2" />you did not want to go up, and you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God.
						</l>
						<l n="27">
							<milestone unit="line" n="3" />And you quarrelled in your tents, and said, “Because of the Lord’s despise
							<milestone unit="line" n="4" />he has brought us out from the land of Egypt, to give us
							<milestone unit="line" n="5" />to the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
						</l>
						<l n="28">Where
							<milestone unit="line" n="6" />are we going? Our brethren have melted our heart, saying,
							<milestone unit="line" n="7" />“The people are greater and taller than we, the cities are walled and reach
							<milestone unit="line" n="8" />the heavens, and we even saw the children of the Anakim
							<milestone unit="line" n="9" />there.””
						</l>
						<l n="29">Then I said to you, “Do not be broken down and
							<milestone unit="line" n="10" />do not fear them.
						</l>
						<l n="30">The Lord your God who goes
							<milestone unit="line" n="11" />before you: he will fight for you according to all that he did
							<milestone unit="line" n="12" />with you in Egypt in your sight,
						</l>
						<l n="31">And in the wilderness,
							<milestone unit="line" n="13" />where you have seen that the Lord your God carried you, like a man carries
							<milestone unit="line" n="14" />his son, all the way that you walked until you came
							<milestone unit="line" n="15" />to this place.”
						</l>
						<l n="32">And in this thing you do not trust
							<milestone unit="line" n="16" />the Lord your God,
						</l>
						<l n="33">Who went
							<milestone unit="line" n="17" />in the way before you to spy you out a place to camp,
							<milestone unit="line" n="18" />in fire by night to show you the way you should go, and
							<milestone unit="line" n="19" />in a cloud by day.
						</l>
						<l n="34">And the Lord heard the
							<milestone unit="line" n="20" />sound of your words and was angry and swore, saying,
						</l>
						<l n="35">
							<milestone unit="line" n="21" />
							<seg type="commented" n="#seg002" />
							<supplied reason="lost">Not a man among these men, this evil generation, will see</supplied>
							<anchor type="commented" xml:id="seg002" /><ref target="#fn2" type="noteAnchor" />
							<milestone unit="page" n="281r" />
							<milestone unit="line" n="1" />the good land that I swore to give to your fathers,
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="2" />
						<l n="36">Just Caleb, son of Jephunneh: he shall see it, and
							<milestone unit="line" n="3" />I will give the land that he has trodden on to him and to his children,
							<milestone unit="line" n="4" />because he has followed the Lord’s order fully.”
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="5" />
						<l n="37">The Lord was angry with me, too, because of you,
							<milestone unit="line" n="6" />saying, “You, too, shall not go there.
						</l>
						<l n="38">Joshua,
							<addSpan spanTo="#add005" />
							<emph>son of Nun</emph>
							<anchor xml:id="add005" />,
							<milestone unit="line" n="7" />who stands before you, he will go there. Strengthen him, because he
							<milestone unit="line" n="8" />will cause Israel to divide it.
						</l>
						<l n="39">And your infants whom you said
							<milestone unit="line" n="9" />will be a prey, and your children who do not know today good
							<milestone unit="line" n="10" />and bad, they will go there, and I will give it to them, and
							<milestone unit="line" n="11" />they shall inherit it.
						</l>
						<l n="40">But you: turn
							<milestone unit="line" n="12" />and set out to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.”
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="13" />
						<l n="41">And you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against the Lord,
							<milestone unit="line" n="14" />we will go and fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded
							<milestone unit="line" n="15" />us.” And you each girded your weapons of war,
							<milestone unit="line" n="16" />you made an agreement to go up to the mountain.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="17" />
						<l n="42">And the Lord said to me, “Say to them, “You shall not go up,
							<milestone unit="line" n="18" />you shall not fight, because my help is not among you, so you will not be defeated
							<milestone unit="line" n="19" />before your enemies.””
						</l>
						<l n="43">And I spoke
							<milestone unit="line" n="20" />to you, and you did not listen but rebelled against the command of the Lord your God,
							<milestone unit="line" n="21" />and you intrigued and went up to the mountain.
						</l>
						<l n="44">And
							<milestone unit="page" n="281v" />
							<milestone unit="line" n="1" />the Amorites, who dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and
							<milestone unit="line" n="2" />chased you, as bees do, and crushed
							<milestone unit="line" n="3" />you in Seir, as far as Hormah.
						</l>
						<l n="45">And you returned and
							<milestone unit="line" n="4" />wept before the Lord, but the Lord did not listen to your voice and
							<milestone unit="line" n="5" />did not give ear to you.
						</l>
						<l n="46">And you stayed
							<milestone unit="line" n="6" />in Kadesh many days — as many days as you stayed in other
							<milestone unit="line" xml:id="line-7-1" n="7" next="ADub.III.73.005.002.trl.xml#line-7-2" />encampments.
