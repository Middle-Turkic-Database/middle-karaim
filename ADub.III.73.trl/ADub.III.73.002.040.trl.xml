						<milestone unit="line" n="20" />
						<l n="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses,
							<milestone unit="line" n="21" />saying,
						</l>
						<l n="2">‘On the day of the first month, on the first
							<milestone unit="page" n="156r" />
							<milestone unit="line" n="1" />day of the month, you shall erect the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="2" />
						<l n="3">And you shall put in it the ark of the law, and
							<milestone unit="line" n="3" />cover the ark with the veil.
						</l>
						<l n="4">
							<milestone unit="line" n="4" />And you shall bring in the table, and arrange its arrangement,
							<milestone unit="line" n="5" />and you shall bring in the lampstand, and light its candles.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="6" />
						<l n="5">And you shall put the altar of gold for the incense
							<milestone unit="line" n="7" />before the ark of the law, and put the cover
							<milestone unit="line" n="8" />of the door to the tabernacle.
						</l>
						<l n="6">And you shall put the altar
							<milestone unit="line" n="9" />of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="10" />
						<l n="7">And you shall put the basin between the tent
							<milestone unit="line" n="11" />of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water there.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="12" />
						<l n="8">And you shall put up the court all around, and put on
							<milestone unit="line" n="13" />the cover for the gate of the court.
						</l>
						<l n="9">And you shall take
							<milestone unit="line" n="14" />the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle, and
							<milestone unit="line" n="15" />all that is in it, and shall sanctify it, and all its
							<milestone unit="line" n="16" />vessels, and it shall be holy.
						</l>
						<l n="10">And you shall anoint
							<milestone unit="line" n="17" />the altar of the burnt offering, and all its vessels, and
							<milestone unit="line" n="18" />sanctify the altar, and the altar shall be holy
							<milestone unit="line" n="19" />of holies.
						</l>
						<l n="11">And you shall anoint the basin and
							<milestone unit="line" n="20" />its place, and sanctify it.
						</l>
						<l n="12">And
							<milestone unit="line" n="21" />you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door
							<milestone unit="page" n="156v" />
							<milestone unit="line" n="1" />of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
						</l>
						<l n="13">And
							<milestone unit="line" n="2" />you shall put on Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and
							<milestone unit="line" n="3" />sanctify him, that he may serve me as priest.
						</l>
						<l n="14">And
							<milestone unit="line" n="4" />you shall bring his sons and put on them the shirts.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="5" />
						<l n="15">And you shall anoint them, as you did anoint
							<milestone unit="line" n="6" />their father, so that they may serve me as priests. And it shall be that their anointing is
							<milestone unit="line" n="7" />an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.’
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="8" />
						<l n="16">And Moses did it, according to all that the Lord commanded him,
							<milestone unit="line" n="9" />he did so.
						</l>
						<l n="17">And it was in the first month, in the second
							<milestone unit="line" n="10" />year, on the first day of the month: the tabernacle was erected.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="11" />
						<l n="18">And Moses erected the tabernacle and put on
							<milestone unit="line" n="12" />its bases and set up its boards and put in
							<milestone unit="line" n="13" />its bars and raised up its pillars.
						</l>
						<l n="19">
							<milestone unit="line" n="14" />And he spread out the tent over the tabernacle
							<milestone unit="line" n="15" />and put the covering of the tent over it,
							<milestone unit="line" n="16" />as the Lord commanded Moses.
						</l>
						<l n="20">And he took
							<milestone unit="line" n="17" />the law and put it into the ark, and he set the
							<milestone unit="line" n="18" />poles on the ark and put the cover
							<milestone unit="line" n="19" />on top of the ark.
						</l>
						<l n="21">And he brought the
							<milestone unit="line" n="20" />ark into the tabernacle and set up the veil of the cover
							<milestone unit="line" n="21" />and covered the ark of the law, as the Lord commanded
							<milestone unit="page" n="157r" />
							<milestone unit="line" n="1" />Moses.
						</l>
						<l n="22">And he put the table in the tent
							<milestone unit="line" n="2" />of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside
							<milestone unit="line" n="3" />the veil.
						</l>
						<l n="23">And he arranged the arrangement
							<milestone unit="line" n="4" />of the showbread before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded
							<milestone unit="line" n="5" />Moses.
						</l>
						<l n="24">And he put the lampstand
							<milestone unit="line" n="6" />in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the
							<milestone unit="line" n="7" />side of the
							<delSpan spanTo="#del001" />altar
							<anchor xml:id="del001" />
							<addSpan spanTo="#add001" />
							<emph>tabernacle</emph>
							<anchor xml:id="add001" />, southward.
						</l>
						<l n="25">And he lighted
							<milestone unit="line" n="8" />the candles before the Lord, as the Lord commanded
							<milestone unit="line" n="9" />Moses.
						</l>
						<l n="26">And he put the golden altar
							<milestone unit="line" n="10" />in the tent of meeting before the veil.
						</l>
						<l n="27">And he burned
							<milestone unit="line" n="11" />fragrant incense on it, as the Lord commanded
							<milestone unit="line" n="12" />Moses.
						</l>
						<l n="28">And he set up the cover
							<milestone unit="line" n="13" />of the door to the tabernacle.
						</l>
						<l n="29">And he put the altar of burnt offering
							<milestone unit="line" n="14" />at the door of <supplied reason="lost">the tabernacle of</supplied> the tent of meeting, and he offered on it
							<milestone unit="line" n="15" />the burnt offering and the grain offering, as the Lord commanded
							<milestone unit="line" n="16" />Moses.
						</l>
						<l n="30">And he set the basin
							<milestone unit="line" n="17" />between the tent of meeting and the altar, and he put
							<milestone unit="line" n="18" />water there, for washing.
						</l>
						<l n="31">And
							<addSpan spanTo="#add002" />
							<emph>Moses and</emph>
							<anchor xml:id="add002" />
							<milestone unit="line" n="19" />Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet there.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="line" n="20" />
						<l n="32">When they came to the tent of meeting, and when they came near
							<milestone unit="line" n="21" />to the altar, they would wash, as the Lord commanded Moses.
						</l>
						<milestone unit="page" n="157v" />
						<milestone unit="line" n="1" />
						<l n="33">And he erected the court around the tabernacle
							<milestone unit="line" n="2" />and the altar, and he set up the cover of the court gate. And
							<milestone unit="line" n="3" />Moses finished the work.

						<l n="35">And Moses was not able
							<milestone unit="line" n="4" />to come into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode on it,
							<milestone unit="line" n="5" />and the divine Presence of the Lord was full in the tabernacle.
						</l>
						<l n="36">And
							<milestone unit="line" n="6" />when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle,

						</l>
						<l n="37">And
							<milestone unit="line" n="8" />if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not journey
							<milestone unit="line" n="9" />until the day that it was taken up.

						<l n="38">Because the cloud of the Lord
							<milestone unit="line" n="10" />was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was there by night,
							<milestone unit="line" n="11" />in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

							<emph>Praise be to Him who stretches the land above great depths and brings out to the light all the mysteries:</emph>

							<milestone unit="line" n="14" />
							<emph>the peshatim of the Book of Exodus are completed.</emph>

							<emph>And God who in his wisdom established the land and created heaven with his reason</emph>

							<emph>and in great numbers brings out their hosts, He will call all of them by name. He will create a true spirit</emph>
							<milestone unit="line" n="17" />
							<emph>and a pure heart for me and will help me to write the peshatim of the Book of Leviticus.</emph>
